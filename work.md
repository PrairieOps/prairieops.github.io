## Work

### Wikipedia Library Project [wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org](https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/)
Picked up development of the [library card platform](https://github.com/WikipediaLibrary/TWLight) where the initial developer left off. Created a straightforward [puppet module](https://github.com/WikipediaLibrary/twlight_puppet) for provisioning in Wikimedia infrastructure and newly created [Vagrant environment](https://github.com/WikipediaLibrary/twlight_vagrant).

### TEL Library [tellibrary.org](https://tellibrary.org/)
Consultation for multisite wordpress architecture and performance.

### Miscellaneous
Created an [Ansible role for hosting multisite wordpress](https://github.com/jsnshrmn/ansible-role-wpn) on behalf of clients. More can be found on on [GitHub](https://github.com/jsnshrmn), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsnsherman/), and [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/u/jsherman).
