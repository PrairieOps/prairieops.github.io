## Highlighted Work

### 2018

#### University of Oklahoma - Gibbs College of Architecture [architecture.ou.edu](https://architecture.ou.edu/)
Created a [WordPress child theme](https://github.com/PrairieOps/mond-ou-child) and wrote a [suite of Galen tests](https://github.com/PrairieOps/architecture.ou.edu-galen-tests) to validate that content displays appropriately across phones, tablets, and computers.

#### TEL Library [tellibrary.org](https://tellibrary.org/)
Consultation for multisite wordpress architecture and performance.

#### Wikipedia Library Project [wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org](https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/)
Integrated the [library card platform](https://github.com/WikipediaLibrary/TWLight) with Travis CI. You can see the builds [here](https://travis-ci.org/WikipediaLibrary/TWLight). This CICD pipeline was completed in part to enable automated integration with partners, such as [translatewiki.net](https://translatewiki.net/), whose volunteer translators are able to contribute localization work without editing code.

#### Miscellaneous
Created an [Ansible role for hosting multisite wordpress](https://github.com/jsnshrmn/ansible-role-wpn) on behalf of clients. More can be found on on [GitHub](https://github.com/jsnshrmn), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsnsherman/), and [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/u/jsherman).


### 2017

#### Wikipedia Library Project [wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org](https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/)
Picked up development of the [library card platform](https://github.com/WikipediaLibrary/TWLight) where the initial developer left off. Created a straightforward [puppet module](https://github.com/WikipediaLibrary/twlight_puppet) for provisioning in Wikimedia infrastructure and newly created [Vagrant environment](https://github.com/WikipediaLibrary/twlight_vagrant).
